Play Spotify music on your Home Assistant device.

![The Spotify Connect add-on](images/screenshot.png)

## About

The Home Assistant Spotify Connect add-on allows you to use your device,
running Home Assistant, to play your Spotify music. This add-on uses the
Spotify Connect protocol, which makes it a device that can be controlled
by all the official clients.

For example; Running Home Assistant on a Raspberry Pi with this add-on
installed will allow you to play your Spotify music on the Pi. So all you'll
have to do is hook up your sound system to the Pi and start booming!

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Home Assistant add-on.

1. Search for the "Spotify Connect" add-on in the Supervisor add-on store
   and install it.
1. Select your audio output device and hit `Save` on that as well.
1. Start the "Spotify Connect" add-on.
1. Check the logs of the "Spotify Connect" to see if everything went well.
1. Ready to go!

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
log_level: info
name: HomeAssistant
bitrate: 320
username: frenck@example.com
password: MySpotifyPassword
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`:  Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

Setting the `log_level` to `debug` will also turn on debug mode on the
Spotify service.

### Option: `name`

The name of your device (the Spotify Connect target), as shown on
the official Spotify clients.

**Note**: _May only contain letters, numbers, hyphens (`-`) and dots (`.`)

### Option: `bitrate`

The bitrate Spotify should use. The higher, the better the sound quality,
however, the add-on consumes more data.

Valid values: `96`, `160` (default) or `320`.

### Option: `username`

**IMPORTANT**: _This requires a Spotify Premium account!_

The username you use to login to your Spotify Premium account. Setting
this will bind the add-on to your account exclusively.

This can be helpful when experiencing discovery issues on your network or
to disallow guests on your network to use the add-on.

### Option: `password`

The password you use to login to your Spotify Premium account.

## Known issues and limitations

- This add-on does support ARM-based devices, nevertheless, they must
  at least be an ARMv7 device. (Raspberry Pi 1 and Zero is not supported).
- This add-on requires a Spotify Premium account.
